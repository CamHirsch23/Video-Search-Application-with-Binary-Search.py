To use this code:

Save it in a Python file, for example, app.py.

Run the file in your terminal or command prompt with python app.py.

The Flask server will start, and you can use a web browser or a tool like Postman to make GET requests to http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?title=Video%20Title to search for videos by title.

Remember to replace Video%20Title with the title you are searching for, making sure to URL encode any spaces or special characters.
